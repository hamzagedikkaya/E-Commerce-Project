# E-Commerce Project

Welcome to the E-Commerce Project!

## Overview

This repository is for an ongoing e-commerce project. The project is being actively developed, and new features and updates are being added regularly.

## Current Status

- **Initial Setup:** The project has been created with Ruby on Rails 7.2.1 and PostgreSQL.
- **Migration:** A few days ago, we created the first migration file and established the initial database schema. This was a foundational step, and the migration will be detailed and expanded as development progresses.
- **Gem Installation:** After adding the first migration, we also installed some foundational gems to help streamline the development process. These gems will aid in various aspects such as authentication, asset management, and testing.
  - **Devise Gem:** Added the `devise` gem for user authentication. This gem simplifies the process of managing user registration, login, password recovery, and more. The integration of `devise` will help provide a robust authentication system for the e-commerce platform.

## Development

I am actively working on this project and plan to add new functionalities and improvements on a daily basis. The roadmap includes:

- Setting up the database schema and initial migrations
- Implementing user authentication and authorization with `devise`
- Developing core e-commerce features such as product management, shopping cart, and order processing
- Integrating payment gateways and additional functionalities
- Enhancing the user interface and experience
