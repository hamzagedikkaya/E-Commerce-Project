# ðŸš€ E-Commerce Application Development with Rails

<<<<<<< HEAD
In this project, my goal is to develop a full-featured **e-commerce application** using **Ruby on Rails**. Initially, I'll focus on building the web platform, with plans to extend it for mobile compatibility later. To kickstart the project, I'm using my custom **Rails Template**: [rails_template](https://github.com/hamzagedikkaya/rails_template). Feel free to use this as a foundation after making the necessary tweaks to suit your needs.

You can directly use the project by cloning or forking it, or you can create a new project yourself by running the following command:
