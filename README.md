# ðŸš€ E-Commerce Application Development with Rails

In this project, my goal is to develop a full-featured **e-commerce application** using **Ruby on Rails**. Initially, I'll focus on building the web platform, with plans to extend it for mobile compatibility later. To kickstart the project, I'm using my custom **Rails Template**: [rails_template](https://github.com/hamzagedikkaya/rails_template). Feel free to use this as a foundation after making the necessary tweaks to suit your needs.

ðŸŒ± This is a **public project** where I make daily updates as part of my learning and development journey. The goal is continuous improvement, adding new features, and optimizing the system regularly. Follow along as the project evolves!
